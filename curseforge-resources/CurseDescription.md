# Better Respawn Fabric

This mod allows you to configure whether beds and respawn anchors set your spawn. This can be enabled or disabled (disabled by default). In addition, an option for the /spawnpoint command is provided as well.

![Default Changes Infographic](https://github.com/Hollikill/Amnesia/blob/master/curseforge-resources/deafult_config_infographic_transparent.png?raw=true)

## Installation

This is a [FABRIC](https://www.fabricmc.net/use/) mod. Simply download this and put in your mods folder. (If you are using a launcher that runs only forge, a mod like [Jumploader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jumploader) is needed)

### Forge Mod Developers

Again, this is a fabric mod. I have no plans to port this to forge, but anyone who wishes to is allowed to. (It would be nice if you credited me) The source code is [here](https://www.github.com/hollikill/Amnesia).

## Configuring The Mod

If you want to change which things set the spawn, I would suggest downloading [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) and using their config editing interface in the game.
